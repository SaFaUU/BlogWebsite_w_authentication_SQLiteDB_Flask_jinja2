# BlogWebsite_w_authentication_SQLiteDB_Flask_jinja2
Fully functional blog website with user authentication and SQlite database with relational tables. Used Warkzueg for password hashing and encoding. Users can post their blogs/ create id/ post comments in this website. When deploying to Heroku I used their Postgres SQL to host the database.
